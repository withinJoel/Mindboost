# Mindboost  
* Your friendly neighborhood **dumb AI** for absolute beginners 🤖💀  
* Made with 💖 by **Joel Jolly** (who definitely over-engineered this for no reason).

## 🚀 About
* Mindboost is a tiny baby AI that doesn’t know machine learning, neural networks, or any fancy “GPT-whatever” stuff.  
* It literally runs on **if-statements**.  
* Yes — the same thing your teacher told you in 6th grade.
* **The whole point?**
* 👉 To show kids (and adults who act like kids) how logic works in programming.
* So instead of scaring newbies with “deep learning” and “vector embeddings,”  
* Perfect for teaching:
    * Logic basics
    * Conditionals
    * “AI but actually not AI”
    * How real devs fake intelligence daily.

## ✨ Features
* Replies using pure if-else chaos  
* Zero dependencies — not even common sense  
* Designed for beginners, schools, and curious humans  
* So simple your grandma could rewrite it  
* Cute enough to make kids like coding  
* Dumb enough to remind you your job is safe 

## 📦 Installation
